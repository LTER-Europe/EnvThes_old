# EnvThes
EnvThes (Environmental Thesaurus) is the controlled vocabulary of the LTER-Europe community. It is coordinated by Umweltbundesamt GmbH, Austria. Here you can find the repository of the SKOS vocabulary. In the issues tab you can request the addition of new terms or the modification of existing terms. For more information on how to do this please consult the Wiki page.
